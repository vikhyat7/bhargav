Hello,

	we have resolved issues which was you given.
	-> If you click on the color thumbnail the main image doesn't change.
	-> On the configurable product page the custom stock status isn't visible when you select any of the color options.

	we have disable our module and checked, configurable product's options are not display so please check and confirm it.

	-> The same happens on the category grid page where the custom stock status isn't visible on the configurable product

Thanks

1-> In a configurable product page there is no short description displayed: 
Done - need to set from the backend in main product

2-> In a simple product page the short descriptions is displayed 2 times:
Done - app/design/frontend/MGS/supro/Magento_Catalog/layout/catalog_product_view.xml

3-> The simple products that have 2 or more images display strangely.
Done - MGS/ExtraGallery/view/frontend/templates/gallery.phtml


4-> When on category grid display, if a product had 2 or more images and you hover on it the image would change. No it is not.
please provide a video for the above issue so we can confirm  is that not working because of our module.


5-> With your module enabled, the color selection is slow.
When it is disabled the color selection is super fast.
because data is comes from the ajax. so after the complete all validation, custom stock status will be change after the fetch response from ajax.

Hello,

    4 When on category grid display, if a product had 2 or more images and you hover on it the image would change. No it is not.
    -> We have disable our module and checked still it's not working.

    5 With your module enabled, the color selection is slow.
       When it is disabled the color selection is super fast.
    -> No, can't possible because it's take some seconds for validation from the script, then custom stock status will set there.

	A. If you change the language to english there is no short description displayed.
	-> Resolved

	B. If you click on More Information tab, the Description field (Details) is displayed again underneath.
	-> it's working properly.

Hello,

    it's custom page (brand's list page), there's no any category : https://nimb.ws/G5yrmh
    and we are provide in those pages which we have described in configuration : https://nimb.ws/O60rtB

    so, it will be customization for display custom stock status on custom page.
