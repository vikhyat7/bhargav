Let me know if it works.



Hello,

	Can you please explain to me why sometimes the button in the product page responds to a mouse click and sometimes not?

	I find that when I open the webpage for the first time sometimes the button responds and other times it goes nowhere.

	--> We have checked your both issue and it's working fine - https://nimb.ws/GVjoeL

Thank You.
